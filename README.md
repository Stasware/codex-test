# Simple Discord Bot

This repository contains a minimal Discord bot demonstrating five basic commands.

## Commands
- `!ping` – Responds with "Pong!" to check if the bot is running.
- `!greet` – Greets the user who invoked the command.
- `!roll [sides]` – Rolls a die with the given number of sides (defaults to six).
- `!flip` – Flips a coin and returns heads or tails.
- `!echo <message>` – Echoes back the provided message.

## Running the bot
1. Install dependencies: `pip install discord.py`
2. Set your Discord bot token in the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.
3. Start the bot with `python bot.py`.

This example is intentionally simple and meant for educational purposes.
